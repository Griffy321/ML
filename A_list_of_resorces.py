#Machine Learning Algorithms for Algorithmic Trading

#Regression Algorithms:
## Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.
## Support Vector Regression (SVR): A type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) used for regression challenges.
## Decision Trees and Random Forests: Tree-based models that can capture non-linear relationships in data.
## Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of its predecessor.

#Time Series Algorithms:
## ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data.
## Prophet: Developed by Facebook, this is a robust time series forecasting library designed for business applications.

#Neural Networks:
## Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): Basic neural network architecture useful for regression and classification.
## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Specialized for sequential data and time series prediction due to their ability to maintain temporal dependencies.
## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Can be applied to time series data by treating it similarly to one-dimensional image data.

#Ensemble Methods:
## Bagging: Combines predictions from multiple models to reduce variance (e.g., Random Forest).
## Boosting: Combines predictions from multiple models sequentially to reduce bias (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).

#Libraries
## Scikit-learn: A widely-used library for classical machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
## TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries for building and training deep learning models, including neural networks.
## PyTorch: An alternative to TensorFlow, popular for research and production applications.
## Statsmodels: Useful for statistical modeling and time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA).
## Facebook Prophet: Designed for time series forecasting with a focus on business applications.
